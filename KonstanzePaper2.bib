  abstract = {We investigate the role of options (contingent claims) in a buyer-supplier
	system. Specifically using a teo-period model with correlated demand,
	we illustrate how options provide flexibility to a buyer to respond
	to market changes in the second period. We also study the implications
	of such arrangements between a buyer and a supplier for coordination
	of the channel. We show that, in general, channel coordination can
	be achieved only if we allow the exercixe price to be piecewise linear.
	We develop sufficient conditions on the cost parameters such that
	linear prices coordinate the channel. We derive the appropriate prices
	for channel coordination which, however, violate the individual rationality
	constraint for the supplier. Contrary to popular be lief (based on
	simpler models) we show that credit for returns offered by the supplier
	does not always coordinate the channel and alleviate the individual
	rationality constraint. Credit for returns are useful only on a subset
	of the feasib},
